            <p class="intro-blurb">Food is a connector of sorts. It builds bridges between people of the same, 
                or different, backgrounds and unlocks memories of the past. As a student who is attending school
                 a bit away (more than a thousand miles) from home, I frequently use food to relive childhood
                  memories and to share a bit of who I am, where I came from, with those around me. In this
                   project, I will share some foods that remind me of home :-) </p>

                            <p class="background-content">Since the weather doesn’t get too cold
                                in Taiwan or California, I prefer my soups to be on the lighter
                                side than on the heavier, creamy side. However, the clam soup my
                                parents and grandparents make is perfect for any weather, whether
                                it be hot or cold outside. The soup is not too filling and can be 
                                consumed prior to the start or at the end of the meal. The freshness 
                                of the clams can be appreciated in the broth and the flavors from 
                                the basil and ginger complement that from the clams very well.
                                If you like seafood or would love to start, or end, your main 
                                meal with a wonderful palate cleanser, this soup is for you!</p>

                                <li>To properly prepare the ingredients, rinse the basil
                                and ginger. Slice the ginger up into thin slivers.
                                Ensure that the clams are well-cleaned by placing
                                it in saltwater for at least 30 minutes</li>
                                <li>Heat up a pot of water on high heat. Once 
                                the water boils, add the clams into the pot.</li>
                                <li>Cook the clams until the shell is slightly ajar, 
                                then turn the heat down to small. Add in a bit of 
                                rice wine to remove potential shellfish aftertaste, 
                                along with ginger. For taste, add in a pinch of pepper 
                                and salt.</li>
                                <li>After 1-2 minutes or until the clams are fully open, 
                                turn off the heat. Add the basil and serve!</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="tip"><i>Tip: </i>The heat should be turned off 
                                after the clams are fully open or else the mean will lose 
                                its tenderness. In addition, the ginger taste will mask all 
                                flavors in the soup if it is heated for too long.</p>

                            <p class="background-content">I spent most of my life near the ocean, 
                                so it is given that seafood is one of my favorite foods, shrimp 
                                being one of them. The tenderness of the shrimp, combined with the 
                                flavor from the rice, is something that I crave whenever I am away 
                                from home. Fortunately, this dish is quite easy to make so home is 
                                not too far away! With this recipe, I hope you’ll enjoy this dish </p>

                                and when we make hot pot, konbu broth is an amazing base that has all the aspects we look for. 
                                Konbu has a slight salty yet sweet taste to it and taste good even on its own! Konbu broth can 
                                be prepared by refrigerating it or heating it up! Attached below is a simple way as to how konbu 
                                broth can be prepared with cold water! Enjoy!</p>
